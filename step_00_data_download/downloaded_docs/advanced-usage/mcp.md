# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard for extending Roo Code's capabilities by connecting to external tools and services.  MCP servers can provide additional tools and resources that Roo Code can use to accomplish tasks.

## Why Use MCP?

*   **Extend Functionality:** Add new capabilities to Roo Code without modifying the core extension.
*   **Access External Data:** Connect to databases, APIs, or other services.
*   **Custom Integrations:** Create custom tools tailored to your specific workflow.
*   **Community Contributions:** Share and use tools developed by the Roo Code community.

## MCP Server Status

You can view and manage your MCP server connections by clicking the <Codicon name="server" /> icon in the top navigation bar.

## Finding and Installing MCP Servers

Roo Code does not come with any pre-installed MCP servers.  You'll need to find and install them separately.

*   **Community Repositories:**  Check for community-maintained lists of MCP servers.  (Link to a hypothetical community repo/list here)
*   **GitHub Search:** Search GitHub for "MCP server" or "Model Context Protocol server."
*   **Ask Roo:**  You can ask Roo Code to help you find or even create MCP servers.

Installation typically involves adding the server's configuration to the `cline_mcp_settings.json` file.  See the [Configuration](#configuration) section for details.

## Using MCP Tools and Resources

Once an MCP server is connected, its tools and resources become available to Roo Code.

*   **Tools:**  MCP tools are invoked using the `use_mcp_tool` tool.  You'll need to provide the server name and the tool name.
*   **Resources:** MCP resources can be accessed using the `access_mcp_resource` tool.  You'll need to provide the server name and the resource URI.

Roo Code will prompt you for any required parameters when using these tools.

## Creating Your Own MCP Server

You can create your own MCP server to add custom functionality to Roo Code.  This requires some programming knowledge.  See the [MCP documentation](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) for details on how to create an MCP server.

## Configuration

MCP server configurations are stored in the `cline_mcp_settings.json` file. You can access it from Roo Code's settings by clicking on "Edit MCP Settings", or you can open it from the VS Code command palette with the `Roo Code: Open MCP Config` command.

The file uses a JSON format:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server1": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/server.py"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "your_api_key"
      },
      "alwaysAllow": ["tool1", "tool2"],
      "disabled": false
    },
    "server2": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/server.js"],
      "timeout": 90
    }
  }
}
```

## Disabling MCP Features

Roo Code provides two settings to control the use of MCP servers, to help you manage token usage and security:

### 1. Disable MCP Servers Entirely

If you don't want to use MCP servers at all, you can disable them completely:

1. Open the Roo Code Settings (<Codicon name="gear" />)
2. Find the "Enable MCP Servers" setting
3. Uncheck the box

This will prevent Roo Code from connecting to any MCP servers, and the `use_mcp_tool` and `access_mcp_resource` tools will not be available. This is the most secure option if you don't intend to use MCP.

### 2. Disable MCP Server Creation

Roo Code can be asked to assist in creating new MCP servers. This is a powerful feature, but it also consumes more tokens and could potentially introduce security risks if used improperly.

To disable MCP server creation:

1. Open the Roo Code Settings (<Codicon name="gear" />)
2. Find the "Enable MCP Server Creation" setting
3. Uncheck the box

With this option disabled, Roo Code will not attempt to create new MCP servers. You can still use existing, manually configured servers.

By default, both of these options are enabled.
