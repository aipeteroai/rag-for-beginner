Just make sure to hold down the shift key after you start dragging the files.\\n- If you\\'re not using [MCP](/advanced-usage/mcp), turn it off in the <Codicon name=\"notebook\" /> Prompts tab to significantly cut down the size of the system prompt.\\n- To keep your [custom modes](/advanced-usage/custom-modes) on track, limit the types of files that they\\'re allowed to edit.\\n- If you hit the dreaded `input length and max tokens exceed context limit` error, you can recover by deleting a message, rolling back to a previous checkpoint, or switching over to a model with a long context window like Gemini for a message.\\n- In general, be thoughtful about your `Max Tokens` setting for thinking models. Every token you allocate to that takes away from space available to store conversation history. Consider only using high `Max Tokens` / `Max Thinking Tokens` settings with modes like Architect and Debug, and keeping Code mode at 16k max tokens or less.\\n- If there\\'s a real world job posting for something you want a custom mode to do, try asking Code mode to `Create a custom mode based on the job posting at @[url]`\\n- If you want to really accelerate, check out multiple copies of your repository and run Roo Code on all of them in parallel (using git to resolve any conflicts, same as with human devs).\\n- Add your own tips by clicking \"Edit this page\" below!\\n'}, {'path': 'faq.md', 'name': 'faq.md', 'content': '# Frequently Asked Questions\\n\\nThis page answers some common questions about Roo Code.\\n\\n## General\\n\\n### What is Roo Code?\\n\\nRoo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent that lives in your editor.\\n\\n### How does Roo Code work?\\n\\nRoo Code uses large language models (LLMs) to understand your requests and translate them into actions.

These tools allow Roo Code to perform actions like:\\n\\n*   Reading and writing files\\n*   Executing commands in the terminal\\n*   Searching your codebase\\n*   Accessing information from the web (with browser support enabled)\\n\\nYou don\\'t need to *tell* Roo Code which tool to use.  Just describe your task in plain English, and Roo Code will determine the appropriate tool (or sequence of tools) to use.  You will always have the opportunity to approve or reject each tool use.\\n\\n## Available Tools\\n\\nHere\\'s a brief overview of the core tools available in Roo Code:\\n\\n| Tool                        | Description                                                                  |\\n| :---------------------------| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| `read_file`                 | Reads the content of a file.                                                 |\\n| `write_to_file`             | Creates a new file or overwrites an existing file with the provided content. |\\n| `apply_diff`                | Applies a set of changes (a \"diff\") to an existing file.                     |\\n| `execute_command`           | Runs a command in the VS Code terminal.                                      |\\n| `search_files`              | Searches for text or a regular expression within files in a directory.       |\\n| `list_files`                | Lists the files and directories within a given directory.                    |\\n| `list_code_definition_names`| Lists code definitions like class names.                                     |\\n| `browser_action`            | Performs actions in a headless browser (if enabled).                         |\\n| `ask_followup_question`     | Asks you a clarifying question.                                              |\\n| `attempt_completion`        | Indicates that Roo Code believes the task is complete.                       |\\n\\n**Note:**  The availability of some tools may depend on the current [mode](./modes.md) and your settings.\\n\\n## How Tools are Used\\n\\n1.  **You describe your task:**  You tell Roo Code what you want to achieve in the chat input.\\n2.  **Roo Code proposes a tool:**  Roo Code analyzes your request and determines which tool (or sequence of tools) is most appropriate.\\n3.  **You review and approve:** Roo Code presents the proposed tool use, including the tool name and any parameters (like the file path or command to execute).  You can review this proposal and either **Approve** or **Reject** it.\\n4.  **Roo Code executes the tool (if approved):** If you approve, Roo Code executes the tool and shows you the result.\\n5.  **Iteration:**  Roo Code may use multiple tools in sequence to complete a task, waiting for your approval after each step.\\n\\n## Example\\n\\nLet\\'s say you want to create a new file named `hello.txt` with the content \"Hello, world!\".  The interaction might look like this:\\n\\n**You:** Create a file named `hello.txt` with the content \"Hello, world!\".\\n\\n**Roo Code:** (Proposes to use the `write_to_file` tool)\\n\\n```xml\\n<write_to_file>\\n<path>hello.txt</path>\\n<content>\\nHello, world!\\n</content>\\n</write_to_file>\\n```\\n\\n**You:** (Click \"Approve\")\\n\\n**Roo Code:** (Confirms that the file was created)\\n\\n## Important Considerations\\n\\n*   Always review proposed actions carefully.  Even though Roo Code is designed to be helpful, it\\'s still an AI, and it can make mistakes.\\n*   Start with small tasks.  Get comfortable with Roo Code\\'s behavior before giving it more complex instructions.\\n*   Use context mentions.  Provide clear context using @ mentions (e.g., @/src/file.ts) to help Roo Code understand your request.\\n*   Use custom instructions.  Guide Roo\\'s behavior even more with custom instructions, or change the prompt using different modes\\n\\n## Advanced Tool Usage\\n\\nRoo Code can be extended with additional tools using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). See the [MCP](../advanced-usage/mcp) section for more details. You can also create [Custom Modes](../advanced-usage/custom-modes) with restricted tool access for enhanced safety and control.'}, {'path': 'basic-usage/context-mentions.md', 'name': 'context-mentions.md', 'content': '# Context Mentions\\n\\nContext mentions are a powerful way to provide Roo Code with specific information about your project, allowing it to perform tasks more accurately and efficiently.  You can use mentions to refer to files, folders, problems, and Git commits.  Context mentions start with the `@` symbol.\\n\\n## Types of Mentions\\n\\n### File Mentions (`@/path/to/file.ts`)\\n\\nUse file mentions to include the contents of a specific file in your request.\\n\\n*   **Example:** \"Explain the function `calculateTotal` in the file @/src/utils.ts.\"\\n*   **How it works:** Roo Code will read the contents of the specified file and include it in the context sent to the AI model.\\n* **Best Practices**: Always include the `/` to tell Roo you\\'re specifying a file path.\\n* **Note:** You can use the `@` character in any chat field, so you may use it while also providing feedback.\\n\\n### Folder Mentions (`@/path/to/folder/`)\\n\\nUse folder mentions to refer to a directory.  Roo Code will be able to use the *names* of the files and subdirectories within that folder.\\n\\n*   **Example:** \"What files are in the @/src/components/ folder?\"\\n* **Note**: To find files inside of that folder, you will need to ask Roo to use one of its tools, `list files`.\\n\\n### Problems Mention (`@problems`)\\n\\nUse the `@problems` mention to include a list of all current errors and warnings from the VS Code Problems panel in your request.\\n\\n*   **Example:** \"@problems Fix all errors in the current file.\"\\n* **Note:** This is especially useful when you see errors in the Problems panel and want Roo Code to address them.\\n\\n### Terminal Mention (`@terminal`)\\n\\nUse the `@terminal` mention to include the last command run in the terminal along with its output.\\n\\n*   **Example:** \"Fix the warnings in the @terminal.\"\\n\\n### Git Commit Mentions (`@a1b2c3d`)\\n\\nUse a Git commit hash (short or long) to include information about a specific commit.\\n\\n*   **Example:** \"What changes were made in commit @a1b2c3d?\"\\n* **Note:** Roo Code will include the commit message, author, date, and a diff of the changes.\\n\\nIf you want to refer to the working changes in the git repository, you can use the `@git-changes` mention.\\n\\n*   **Example:** \"Can you propose a commit message for @git-changes?\"\\n\\n### URL Mentions (`@https://example.com`)\\n\\nUse a URL to have Roo Code fetch and include the content of a website.\\n\\n*   **Example:** \"Summarize the content of @https://docusaurus.io/.\"\\n*   **Note:** Roo Code will convert the website content to Markdown.\\n\\n## Using Mentions\\n\\n*   **Type `@`:** Start typing `@` in the chat input field.  A dropdown menu will appear with suggestions.\\n*   **Select a Mention:** Use the arrow keys or your mouse to select the desired mention from the dropdown, and press Enter or click to insert it.\\n*   **Type to Search:** As you type after the `@` symbol, the suggestions will be filtered.\\n* **Multiple Mentions:** You can include multiple mentions in a single message.\\n*   **Combine with Text:** You can combine mentions with regular text to create your request.  For example: \"Check the function in @/src/utils.ts and fix any @problems\".\\n\\n## Tips\\n\\n*   **Be Specific:** The more specific your mentions are, the better Roo Code will understand your request.\\n*   **Use Relative Paths:** When referring to files within your workspace, use paths relative to the workspace root.\\n*   **Check for Typos:** Make sure the file paths and commit hashes are correct.\\n\\nContext mentions are a powerful tool for providing Roo Code with the information it needs to complete your tasks effectively.  Experiment with different types of mentions to see how they can improve your workflow.\\n'}, {'path': 'basic-usage/typing-your-requests.md', 'name': 'typing-your-requests.md', 'content': '# Typing Your Requests\\n\\nRoo Code is designed to understand natural language.  You don\\'t need to use any special commands or syntax to communicate with it.  Just type your request in plain English, as if you were talking to a human developer.\\n\\n## Best Practices\\n\\n*   **Be Clear and Specific:**  Clearly state what you want Roo Code to do.  Avoid vague or ambiguous language.  For example, instead of saying \"Fix the code,\" say \"Fix the bug in the `calculateTotal` function that causes it to return incorrect results.\"\\n*   **Provide Context:**  If your request refers to specific files, functions, or parts of your code, use [Context Mentions](./context-mentions) to provide that context.\\n*   **Break Down Complex Tasks:**  For large or complex tasks, break them down into smaller, more manageable steps.  Roo Code works best when given focused instructions.\\n*   **Use Examples:** If you want Roo Code to generate code in a specific style, provide examples.\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\nHere are some examples of well-formed requests:\\n\\n*   \"Create a new file named `utils.py` and add a function called `add` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.\"\\n*   \"In the file `src/components/Button.tsx`, change the color of the button to blue.\"\\n*   \"Find all instances of the variable `oldValue` in the file `/src/App.js` and replace them with `newValue`.\"\\n*   \"Run the command `npm install` in the terminal.\"\\n*   \"Explain the function `calculateTotal` in the file `/src/utils.ts`.\"\\n* \"@problems Address all detected problems.\"\\n\\n## What *Not* to Do\\n\\n*   **Don\\'t be vague:** Avoid requests like \"Fix the code\" or \"Make it better.\"\\n*   **Don\\'t assume Roo Code knows what you\\'re thinking:** Provide all necessary context.\\n*   **Don\\'t use jargon unnecessarily:** Use plain English whenever possible.\\n*   **Don\\'t give multiple unrelated instructions in a single request:** Break down complex tasks into smaller steps.\\n*   **Don\\'t assume a request was successful:** Always wait for confirmation from Roo Code after each tool use.'}, {'path': 'basic-usage/modes.md', 'name': 'modes.md', 'content': '# Using Modes\\n\\nRoo Code offers different \"modes\" to tailor its behavior and capabilities to specific tasks. Think of modes as different personas or roles that Roo Code can adopt. Each mode has a specific focus, and some modes have restrictions on the tools they can use.  This helps to ensure that Roo Code stays on task and avoids unintended actions.\\n\\n## Built-in Modes\\n\\nRoo Code comes with four built-in modes:\\n\\n*   **Code Mode (Default):** This is the general-purpose coding mode.  Roo Code can read, write, and execute code in this mode. It\\'s designed for tasks like creating new features, refactoring existing code, and fixing bugs.\\n\\n*   **Architect Mode:** This mode is for high-level planning and design discussions. Roo Code can read files in this mode, but it *cannot* write to files or execute commands. Use this mode to discuss system architecture, design patterns, or overall project structure.\\n\\n*   **Ask Mode:** This mode is for asking questions and getting explanations. Roo Code can read files, access external resources, but it *cannot* modify files or run commands. Use this mode to understand code, explore concepts, or get help with specific problems. You can use this mode to learn more about new or existing code.\\n\\n*   **Debug Mode:** This mode is specifically designed for systematic problem diagnosis. It uses a structured approach where Roo Code first analyzes potential causes, narrows down the most likely explanations, and validates them through strategic logging before implementing fixes. This methodical process helps ensure more accurate bug fixes.\\n\\n## Why Use Modes?\\n\\nModes help to:\\n\\n*   **Focus Roo Code\\'s responses:**  Each mode has a specific \"role definition\" and instructions that guide its behavior.\\n*   **Improve safety:**  Modes like Architect and Ask restrict Roo Code\\'s ability to modify files or run commands, reducing the risk of unintended changes.\\n*   **Optimize for different tasks:**  The Code mode is designed for active coding, while the Architect mode is better for planning, and the Ask mode is best for understanding.\\n\\n## Switching Modes\\n\\nYou can switch between modes using the dropdown menu in the chat input area:\\n\\n1.  **Locate the Dropdown:**  Find the dropdown menu to the left of the chat input box. It will usually display the name of the current mode (e.g., \"Code\", \"Architect\", \"Ask\", \"Debug\").\\n\\n2.  **Select a Mode:** Click the dropdown and choose the mode you want to use.\\n\\nRoo Code will remember the last used API configuration for each mode, making it easy to switch between different providers or models for different tasks.\\n\\nHint: You can also use the `/` command to switch modes.  For example, `/architect` will switch to Architect Mode.\\n\\n## Custom Modes\\n\\nRoo Code also allows you to create your own custom modes, with tailored instructions and tool permissions.  See the [Advanced Usage: Custom Modes](./../advanced-usage/custom-modes) section for more information.\\n\\n## Tips\\n\\n*   Start in **Code Mode** for most coding tasks.\\n*   Switch to **Architect Mode** when planning or discussing high-level design.\\n*   Use **Ask Mode** when you need to understand code or concepts.\\n*   Switch to **Debug Mode** when tracking down bugs.\\n*   Create **Custom Modes** to optimize Roo Code for your own project and workflows.\\n*   Experiment with different modes to find what works best!\\n'}, {'path': 'basic-usage/the-chat-interface.md', 'name': 'the-chat-interface.md', 'content': '# The Chat Interface\\n\\nThe Roo Code chat interface is your primary way of interacting with it.

This API allows extensions to provide access to language models directly within VS Code.  This means you can potentially use models from:\\n\\n*   **GitHub Copilot:** If you have a Copilot subscription and the extension installed.\\n*   **Other VS Code Extensions:** Any extension that implements the Language Model API.\\n\\n**Important:** This integration is highly experimental and may not work as expected.  It is dependent on other extensions correctly implementing the VS Code Language Model API.\\n\\n## Prerequisites\\n\\n*   **VS Code:**  The Language Model API is available through VS Code (and is not currently supported by Cursor).\\n*   **A Language Model Provider Extension:**  You need an extension that provides a language model.  Examples include:\\n    *   **GitHub Copilot:**  If you have a Copilot subscription, the GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Chat extensions can provide models.\\n    *   **Other Extensions:**  Search the VS Code Marketplace for extensions that mention \"Language Model API\" or \"lm\".  There may be other experimental extensions available.\\n\\n## Configuration\\n\\n1.  **Open Roo Code Settings:** Click the gear icon (<Codicon name=\"gear\" />) in the Roo Code panel.\\n2.  **Select Provider:** Choose \"VS Code LM API\" from the \"API Provider\" dropdown.\\n3.  **Select Model:**  The \"Language Model\" dropdown will (eventually) list available models.

For example, if you have Copilot, you might see options like:\\n    *   `copilot - claude-3.5-sonnet`\\n    *   `copilot - o3-mini`\\n    *   `copilot - o1-ga`\\n    *   `copilot - gemini-2.0-flash`\\n\\n## Limitations\\n\\n*   **Experimental API:**  The VS Code Language Model API is still under development.  Expect changes and potential instability.\\n*   **Extension Dependent:**  This feature relies entirely on other extensions providing models.  Roo Code cannot directly control which models are available.\\n*   **Limited Functionality:**  The VS Code Language Model API may not support all the features of other API providers (e.g., image input, streaming, detailed usage information).\\n*   **No Direct Cost Control:**  You are subject to the pricing and terms of the extension providing the model.  Roo Code cannot directly track or limit costs.\\n\\n## Troubleshooting\\n\\n*   **No Models Appear:**\\n    *   Ensure you have VS Code installed.\\n    *   Ensure you have a language model provider extension installed and enabled (e.g., GitHub Copilot, GitHub Copilot Chat).\\n    *   If using Copilot, make sure that you have sent a Copilot Chat message using the model you would like to use.\\n*   **Unexpected Behavior:**  If you encounter unexpected behavior, it\\'s likely an issue with the underlying Language Model API or the provider extension.

Some recommended models for coding tasks include:\\n\\n    *   `codellama:7b-code` (good starting point, smaller)\\n    *   `codellama:13b-code` (better quality, larger)\\n    *   `codellama:34b-code` (even better quality, very large)\\n    *   `qwen2.5-coder:32b`\\n    *   `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1` (good general-purpose model)\\n    *   `deepseek-coder:6.7b-base` (good for coding tasks)\\n    *   `llama3:8b-instruct-q5_1` (good for general tasks)\\n\\n    To download a model, open your terminal and run:\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    ollama pull <model_name>\\n    ```\\n\\n    For example:\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:32b\\n    ```\\n\\n3. **Configure the Model:** by default, Ollama uses a context window size of 2048 tokens, which is too small for Roo Code requests. You need to have at least 12k to get decent results, ideally - 32k.

Command output allows Roo Code to react to the result of the command on its own, without you having to handhold by copy-pasting the output in yourself. It\\'s also quite powerful when running development servers as it allows Roo Code to fix errors as the server logs them.\\n\\n## How Shell Integration Works\\n\\nShell integration uses special terminal sequences (like ANSI escape codes) to mark different stages of command execution in your terminal. Here\\'s how it works:\\n\\n1. **Activation**: When you open a terminal in VSCode, your shell sends an activation sequence (`\\\\x1b]633;A\\\\x07`) to initialize shell integration.\\n\\n2. **Command Lifecycle**: VSCode shell integration uses OSC (Operating System Command) sequence 633 to track each command\\'s lifecycle:\\n   - OSC 633 ; A - Mark prompt start\\n   - OSC 633 ; B - Mark command start\\n   - OSC 633 ; C - Mark command executed (pre-output)\\n   - OSC 633 ; D [; `<exitcode>`] - Mark command finished with optional exit code\\n   - OSC 633 ; E ; `<commandline>` [; `<nonce>`] - Explicitly set command line with optional nonce\\n   - OSC 633 ; P ; `<Property>=<Value>` - Set properties like current working directory\\n\\n3. **Shell Integration Hooks**: Each shell uses specific hooks for different stages of command execution:\\n\\n   - Bash:\\n     * Initial activation: `PROMPT_COMMAND` (sets up initial environment)\\n     * Command start: `trap DEBUG` (triggers before command execution)\\n     * Command stop: `PROMPT_COMMAND` (triggers after command completion)\\n\\n   - Zsh:\\n     * Initial activation: `precmd` (sets up initial environment)\\n     * Command start: `preexec` (triggers before command execution)\\n     * Command stop: `precmd` (triggers after command completion)\\n\\n   - PowerShell:\\n     * Initial activation: `prompt` function (sets up initial environment)\\n     * Command input: `PSConsoleHostReadLine` (captures command input)\\n     * Command start/stop: `prompt` function (handles both command start and completion)\\n\\n   - Fish:\\n     * Initial activation: `fish_prompt` (sets up initial environment)\\n     * Command start: `fish_preexec` (triggers before command execution)\\n     * Command stop: `fish_prompt` (triggers after command completion)\\n\\n> **Note:** This hook implementation information was discovered through AI inspection of the VSCode source tree. If you find any inaccuracies, please submit a pull request with corrections.\\n\\nThese hooks emit OSC (Operating System Command) sequences that VSCode recognizes to track:\\n   - Prompt start/end positions\\n   - Command start/execution/finish events\\n   - Current working directory changes\\n   - Command line content and execution status\\n\\n4. **Output Capture**: When a command runs, VSCode captures:\\n   - Command text and working directory\\n   - Start and end times\\n   - Exit codes\\n   - Output streams (stdout/stderr)\\n\\nThis allows VSCode and extensions like Roo Code to:\\n- Know exactly when commands start and finish\\n- Capture command output reliably\\n- Track command success/failure\\n- Update the terminal UI with command status\\n- React to command results automatically\\n- Track the current working directory\\n\\n## How to Fix \"Shell Integration Unavailable\"\\n\\n### Step 1: Update VSCode or Cursor\\n\\nFirst, make sure you\\'re using the latest version of VSCode or Cursor:\\n\\n1. Open VSCode or Cursor\\n2. Press `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux)\\n3. Type \"Check for Updates\" (VSCode) or \"Attempt Update\" (Cursor) and select it\\n4. Restart VSCode/Cursor after the update\\n\\n### Step 2: Configure VSCode to Use the Correct Shell\\n\\n1. Open VSCode\\n2. Press `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux)\\n3. Type \"Terminal: Select Default Profile\" and choose it\\n4. Select one of the supported shells: zsh, bash, fish, or PowerShell.\\n\\n### Step 3: Restart VSCode\\n\\nAfter making these changes:\\n\\n1. Quit VSCode completely\\n2. Reopen VSCode\\n3. Start a new Roo Code session (you can resume your previous task and try to run the command again, this time with Roo Code being able to see the output)\\n\\n## Additional Troubleshooting for Windows Users\\n\\nIf you\\'re using Windows and still experiencing issues with shell integration after trying the previous steps, it\\'s recommended you use Git Bash.\\n\\n### Git Bash\\n\\nGit Bash is a terminal emulator that provides a Unix-like command line experience on Windows. To use Git Bash, you need to:\\n\\n1. Download and run the Git for Windows installer from [https://git-scm.com/downloads/win](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)\\n2. Quit and re-open VSCode\\n3. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open the Command Palette\\n4. Type \"Terminal: Select Default Profile\" and choose it\\n5. Select \"Git Bash\"\\n\\n### PowerShell\\n\\nIf you\\'d still like to use PowerShell, make sure you\\'re using an updated version (at least v7+).\\n  - Check your current PowerShell version by running: `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion`\\n  - If your version is below 7, [update PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/whats-new/migrating-from-windows-powershell-51-to-powershell-7?view=powershell-7.4#installing-powershell-7).\\n\\n#### Understanding PowerShell Execution Policies\\n\\nPowerShell uses execution policies to determine which scripts can run on your system. Here are the most common policies:\\n\\n- `Restricted`: No PowerShell scripts can run. This is the default setting.\\n- `AllSigned`: All scripts, including local ones, must be signed by a trusted publisher.\\n- `RemoteSigned`: Scripts created locally can run, but scripts downloaded from the internet must be signed.\\n- `Unrestricted`: No restrictions. Any script can run, though you will be warned before running internet-downloaded scripts.\\n\\nFor development work in VSCode, the `RemoteSigned` policy is generally recommended. It allows locally created scripts to run without restrictions while maintaining security for downloaded scripts. To learn more about PowerShell execution policies and understand the security implications of changing them, visit Microsoft\\'s documentation: [About Execution Policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies).\\n\\n#### Steps to Change the Execution Policy\\n\\n1. Open PowerShell as an Administrator: Press `Win + X` and select \"Windows PowerShell (Administrator)\" or \"Windows Terminal (Administrator)\".\\n\\n2. Check Current Execution Policy by running this command:\\n     ```powershell\\n     Get-ExecutionPolicy\\n     ```\\n   - If the output is already `RemoteSigned`, `Unrestricted`, or `Bypass`, you likely don\\'t need to change your execution policy. These policies should allow shell integration to work.\\n   - If the output is `Restricted` or `AllSigned`, you may need to change your policy to enable shell integration.\\n\\n3. Change the Execution Policy by running the following command:\\n     ```powershell\\n     Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser\\n     ```\\n   - This sets the policy to `RemoteSigned` for the current user only, which is safer than changing it system-wide.\\n\\n4. Confirm the Change by typing `Y` and pressing Enter when prompted.\\n\\n5. Verify the Policy Change by running `Get-ExecutionPolicy` again to confirm the new setting.\\n\\n6. Restart VSCode and try the shell integration again.\\n\\n## Manual Shell Integration Installation\\n\\nIf you\\'re still experiencing issues after trying the basic troubleshooting steps, you can try manually installing shell integration:\\n\\n### Installation Instructions\\n\\nFor Bash users:\\n1. Run `code ~/.bashrc` in the terminal to open your bash configuration file.\\n2. Add the following line to your `~/.bashrc`:\\n```bash\\n[[ \"$TERM_PROGRAM\" == \"vscode\" ]] && . \"$(code --locate-shell-integration-path bash)\"\\n```\\n\\nFor Zsh users:\\n1. Run `code ~/.zshrc` in the terminal to open your zsh configuration file.\\n2. Add the following line to your `~/.zshrc`:\\n```bash\\n[[ \"$TERM_PROGRAM\" == \"vscode\" ]] && . \"$(code --locate-shell-integration-path zsh)\"\\n```\\n\\nFor PowerShell users:\\n1. Run `code $Profile` in the terminal to open your PowerShell profile.\\n2. Add the following line to the file:\\n```powershell\\nif ($env:TERM_PROGRAM -eq \"vscode\") { . \"$(code --locate-shell-integration-path pwsh)\" }\\n```\\n\\nFor Fish users:\\n1. Run `code ~/.config/fish/config.fish` in the terminal to open your fish configuration file.\\n2. Add the following line to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:\\n```fish\\nstring match -q \"$TERM_PROGRAM\" \"vscode\"; and . (code --locate-shell-integration-path fish)\\n```\\n\\n### About the Shell Integration Path Command\\n\\nThe `code --locate-shell-integration-path` command returns the path to shell-specific integration scripts. It supports four shell types:\\n- bash - returns path to `shellIntegration-bash.sh`\\n- zsh - returns path to `shellIntegration-rc.zsh`\\n- pwsh - returns path to `shellIntegration.ps1`\\n- fish - returns path to `shellIntegration.fish`\\n\\nAny other value will throw an error: \"Error using `--locate-shell-integration-path`: Invalid shell type\".\\n\\n## Unusual Terminal Output\\n\\nIf you\\'re seeing unusual output with rectangles, lines, escape sequences, or control characters, it may be related to terminal customization tools. Common culprits include:\\n\\n- Powerlevel10k: A zsh theme that adds visual elements to the prompt. If using Powerlevel10k, you must set `typeset -g POWERLEVEL9K_TERM_SHELL_INTEGRATION=true` in your `~/.zshrc` before sourcing the theme. This enables proper integration with VSCode\\'s shell integration, which differs from the integration provided by VSCE.\\n- Oh My Zsh: A framework for managing zsh configurations\\n- Fish shell themes\\n\\nTo troubleshoot:\\n\\n1. For Powerlevel10k users:\\n   ```bash\\n   # Add this line before sourcing powerlevel10k in ~/.zshrc\\n   typeset -g POWERLEVEL9K_TERM_SHELL_INTEGRATION=true\\n   ```\\n\\n2. If issues persist, temporarily disable these tools in your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.zshrc` for Zsh)\\n3. If the issue resolves, gradually re-enable features to identify the conflicting component\\n\\n## Advanced Troubleshooting\\n\\n### Shell Integration Not Available\\n\\nShell integration activation sequence (`\\\\x1b]633;A\\\\x07`) was not received. Shell integration features are disabled. Verify you are using a supported shell (Bash, Zsh, PowerShell, Fish) and shell integration is enabled in settings.\\n\\n### Command Stream Not Available\\n\\nCommand stream failed: missing start sequence (`\\\\x1b]633;C\\\\x07`) or command already ended (`\\\\x1b]633;D\\\\x07`). Command output cannot be captured. Check if the command started correctly or has completed execution.\\n\\n### Verifying Shell Integration Status\\n\\nRun these commands to verify shell integration sequences are installed:\\n\\n#### Bash\\n```bash\\n# View all shell integration sequences\\nset | grep -i \\'[16]33;\\'\\n\\n# Should show VSCode shell integration functions like:\\n# printf \\'\\\\e]633;E;%s;%s\\\\a\\' - Command line set\\n# printf \\'\\\\e]633;C\\\\a\\' - Command executed\\n# printf \\'\\\\e]633;D\\\\a\\' - Command finished\\n# printf \\'\\\\e]633;B\\\\a\\' - Command start\\n# printf \\'\\\\e]633;A\\\\a\\' - Shell integration activated\\n# printf \\'\\\\e]633;P;Prompt=%s\\\\a\\' - Prompt marker\\n\\n# Check for PROMPT_COMMAND and DEBUG trap\\necho \"$PROMPT_COMMAND\" | grep vsc\\ntrap -p DEBUG | grep vsc\\n```\\n\\n#### Zsh\\n```zsh\\n# List all VSCode shell integration functions\\nfunctions | grep -i vsc  # Should show __vsc_precmd, __vsc_preexec, etc.\\n\\n# Verify shell integration hooks are installed\\ntypeset -p precmd_functions preexec_functions  # Should include __vsc_precmd and __vsc_preexec\\n\\n# Check Powerlevel10k integration (if installed)\\n(( ${+functions[p10k]} )) && typeset -p POWERLEVEL9K_TERM_SHELL_INTEGRATION  # Should show \"true\"\\n```\\n\\n#### PowerShell\\n```powershell\\n# View shell integration functions\\nGet-Command -Name \"*VSC*\" -CommandType Function\\n\\n# Check prompt function\\nGet-Content Function:\\\\Prompt | Select-String \"VSCode\"\\n```\\n\\n#### Fish\\n```fish\\n# Check for shell integration functions\\nfunctions | grep -i vsc\\n\\n# Verify fish_prompt and fish_preexec hooks\\nfunctions fish_prompt | grep -i vsc\\nfunctions fish_preexec | grep -i vsc\\n```\\n\\nVisual indicators of active shell integration:\\n1.

Here are some tips for working with large codebases:\\n\\n## Understanding Context Limits\\n\\nRoo Code uses large language models (LLMs) that have a limited \"context window.\"  This is the maximum amount of text (measured in tokens) that the model can process at once.  If the context is too large, the model may not be able to understand your request or generate accurate responses.\\n\\nThe context window includes:\\n\\n*   The system prompt (instructions for Roo Code).\\n*   The conversation history.\\n*   The content of any files you mention using `@`.\\n*   The output of any commands or tools Roo Code uses.\\n\\n## Strategies for Managing Context\\n\\n1.  **Be Specific:**  When referring to files or code, use specific file paths and function names.  Avoid vague references like \"the main file.\"\\n\\n2.  **Use Context Mentions Effectively:** Use `@/path/to/file.ts` to include specific files. Use `@problems` to include current errors and warnings.  Use `@` followed by a commit hash to reference specific Git commits.\\n\\n3.  **Break Down Tasks:** Divide large tasks into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks.  This helps keep the context focused.\\n\\n4.  **Summarize:**  If you need to refer to a large amount of code, consider summarizing the relevant parts in your prompt instead of including the entire code.\\n\\n5.  **Prioritize Recent History:** Roo Code automatically truncates older messages in the conversation history to stay within the context window. Be mindful of this, and re-include important context if needed.\\n\\n6.  **Use Prompt Caching (if available):** Some API providers like OpenRouter support \"prompt caching\". This caches your prompts for use in future tasks and helps reduce the cost and latency of requests.\\n\\n## Example: Refactoring a Large File\\n\\nLet\\'s say you need to refactor a large TypeScript file (`src/components/MyComponent.tsx`).  Here\\'s a possible approach:\\n\\n1.  **Initial Overview:**\\n    ```\\n    @/src/components/MyComponent.tsx List the functions and classes in this file.\\n    ```\\n\\n2.  **Target Specific Functions:**\\n    ```\\n    @/src/components/MyComponent.tsx Refactor the `processData` function to use `async/await` instead of Promises.\\n    ```\\n\\n3.  **Iterative Changes:**  Make small, incremental changes, reviewing and approving each step.\\n\\nBy breaking down the task and providing specific context, you can work effectively with large files even with a limited context window.'}, {'path': 'advanced-usage/enhance-prompt.md', 'name': 'enhance-prompt.md', 'content': '# Enhance Prompt\\n\\nThe \"Enhance Prompt\" feature in Roo Code helps you improve the quality and effectiveness of your prompts before sending them to the AI model.  By clicking the ✨ (sparkle) icon in the chat input, you can automatically refine your initial request, making it clearer, more specific, and more likely to produce the desired results.\\n\\n## Why Use Enhance Prompt?\\n\\n*   **Improved Clarity:**  Roo Code can rephrase your prompt to make it more understandable for the AI model.\\n*   **Added Context:**  The enhancement process can add relevant context to your prompt, such as the current file path or selected code.\\n*   **Better Instructions:**  Roo Code can add instructions to guide the AI towards a more helpful response (e.g., requesting specific formatting or a particular level of detail).\\n*   **Reduced Ambiguity:**  Enhance Prompt helps to eliminate ambiguity and ensure that Roo Code understands your intent.\\n*   **Consistency**: Roo will consistently format prompts the same way to the AI.\\n\\n## How to Use Enhance Prompt\\n\\n1.  **Type your initial prompt:**  Enter your request in the Roo Code chat input box as you normally would.  This can be a simple question, a complex task description, or anything in between.\\n2.  **Click the <Codicon name=\"sparkle\" /> Icon:**  Instead of pressing Enter, click the <Codicon name=\"sparkle\" /> icon located to the left of the chat input box.\\n3.  **Review the Enhanced Prompt:**  Roo Code will replace your original prompt with an enhanced version.  Review the enhanced prompt to make sure it accurately reflects your intent. You can further refine the enhanced prompt before sending.\\n4.  **Send the Enhanced Prompt:**  Press Enter or click the Send icon (<Codicon name=\"send\" />) to send the enhanced prompt to Roo Code.\\n\\n## Customizing the Enhancement Process\\n\\nThe \"Enhance Prompt\" feature uses a customizable prompt template.  You can modify this template to tailor the enhancement process to your specific needs.\\n\\n1.  **Open the Prompts Tab:** Click the <Codicon name=\"notebook\" /> icon in the Roo Code top menu bar.\\n2.  **Select \"ENHANCE\" Tab:** You should see listed out support prompts, including \"ENHANCE\". Click on this tab.\\n3.  **Edit the Prompt Template:** Modify the text in the \"Prompt\" field.\\n\\nThe default prompt template includes the placeholder `${userInput}`, which will be replaced with your original prompt. You can modify this to fit the model\\'s prompt format, and instruct it how to enhance your request.\\n\\n## API Configuration\\n\\nThe API configuration used for Enhance Prompt is, by default, the same one that is selected for Roo Code tasks,\\nbut it can be changed:\\n\\n1.  **Open the Prompts Tab:** Click the <Codicon name=\"notebook\" /> icon in the Roo Code top menu bar.\\n2.  **Select \"ENHANCE\" Tab:** You should see an \"API Configuration\" dropdown\\n3.  **Select an API Configuration:** Choose an existing configuration, and future Enhance Prompt requests will be sent to that configured provider/model.\\n\\n## Limitations and Best Practices\\n\\n*   **Experimental Feature:**  Prompt enhancement is an experimental feature. The quality of the enhanced prompt may vary depending on the complexity of your request and the capabilities of the underlying model.\\n*   **Review Carefully:**  Always review the enhanced prompt before sending it.  Roo Code may make changes that don\\'t align with your intentions.\\n*   **Iterative Process:**  You can use the \"Enhance Prompt\" feature multiple times to iteratively refine your prompt.\\n*   **Not a Replacement for Clear Instructions:** While \"Enhance Prompt\" can help, it\\'s still important to write clear and specific prompts from the start.\\n\\nBy using the \"Enhance Prompt\" feature, you can improve the quality of your interactions with Roo Code and get more accurate and helpful responses.\\n'}, {'path': 'advanced-usage/code-actions.md', 'name': 'code-actions.md', 'content': '# Code Actions\\n\\nCode Actions are a powerful feature of VS Code that provide quick fixes, refactorings, and other code-related suggestions directly within the editor.

This can save you time and help you write better code.\\n'}, {'path': 'advanced-usage/model-temperature.md', 'name': 'model-temperature.md', 'content': '# Adjusting Model Temperature\\n\\nRoo Code allows you to control the \"temperature\" setting for your AI models. Temperature is a crucial parameter that influences the randomness and creativity of the model\\'s output.  Understanding and adjusting temperature is particularly useful for getting the best results from different modes, like **Architect** and **Ask**, where more creative or varied responses might be desired.\\n\\n## What is Temperature?\\n\\nTemperature is a parameter that controls the randomness of the model\\'s predictions. It\\'s a value, typically between 0.0 and 1.0 (though some providers might accept different value ranges).\\n\\n*   **Lower Temperature (closer to 0.0):** The model becomes more deterministic and focused. It will select the most probable, predictable outputs. This is good for tasks requiring precision and correctness, like code generation.\\n*   **Higher Temperature (closer to 1.0):** The model becomes more creative and unpredictable. It will explore less likely, more diverse outputs. This is useful for brainstorming, generating different variations of text, or exploring different design options.\\n\\n## Why Adjust Temperature?\\n\\nDifferent tasks benefit from different temperature settings.  For example:\\n\\n*   **Code Mode (Low Temperature):** When writing code, you generally want precise and correct results.  A lower temperature (e.g., 0.0 - 0.3) is usually best.\\n*   **Architect Mode (Medium Temperature):** When brainstorming architectural designs, you might want more creative suggestions.  A medium temperature (e.g., 0.4 - 0.7) can be helpful.\\n*   **Ask Mode (Medium to High Temperature):** When asking open-ended questions or seeking explanations, a higher temperature (e.g., 0.7 - 1.0) can lead to more diverse and insightful responses.  You might even go higher for creative writing tasks.\\n*   **Debug Mode (Low Temperature):** When tracking down bugs, you want precise and correct results.  A lower temperature (e.g., 0.0 - 0.3) is usually best.\\n\\n## How to Adjust Temperature in Roo Code\\n\\nYou can adjust the temperature in the Roo Code settings:\\n\\n1.  **Open the Roo Code Panel:** Click the Roo Code icon (<Codicon name=\"rocket\" />) in the VS Code Activity Bar.\\n2.  **Open Settings:** Click the <Codicon name=\"gear\" /> icon in the top right corner of the Roo Code panel.\\n3.  **Find the Temperature Setting:** In the settings panel, you\\'ll find a \"Use custom temperature\" setting within the API configuration section.\\n4.  **Enter the Temperature Value:** Check the box and enter the temperature value you want to use. The range is typically from 0.0 to 1.0, but this may depend on the specific model and provider.\\n\\n## Per-API Configuration Profiles\\n\\nRoo Code allows you to create multiple [API configuration profiles](api-configuration-profiles).  This is *very* useful for managing temperature settings. You can:\\n\\n*   **Create a \"Code - Low Temp\" profile:** Configure this profile with your preferred API provider, a code-focused model (like Claude 3.5 Sonnet), and a low temperature (e.g., 0.1).\\n*   **Create an \"Ask - High Temp\" profile:** Configure this profile with the same provider (or a different one), perhaps a model better suited for general knowledge, and a higher temperature (e.g., 0.8).\\n*   **Switch Profiles:**  Use the \"Configuration Profile\" dropdown in the Roo Code settings to quickly switch between your saved configurations.  You can also set a default configuration for each mode (Code, Architect, Ask, Debug), so Roo Code automatically uses the appropriate settings when you switch modes.\\n\\nThis lets you tailor the AI\\'s behavior to the specific task at hand without constantly adjusting settings.\\n\\n## Experimentation\\n\\nThe best way to understand the effect of temperature is to experiment. Try different values and see how they impact the model\\'s output, or do some research online. You may find that different temperatures work best for different tasks or even for different parts of the same task.'}, {'path': 'advanced-usage/custom-modes.md', 'name': 'custom-modes.md', 'content': '# Custom Modes\\n\\nRoo Code allows you to create **custom modes** to tailor Roo\\'s behavior to specific tasks or workflows. Custom modes can be either **global** (available across all projects) or **project-specific** (defined within a single project).  They allow you to define:\\n\\n*   **A unique name and slug:** For easy identification\\n*   **A role definition:** Placed at the beginning of the system prompt, this defines Roo\\'s core expertise and personality for the mode. This placement is crucial as it shapes Roo\\'s fundamental understanding and approach to tasks\\n*   **Custom instructions:** Added at the end of the system prompt, these provide specific guidelines that modify or refine Roo\\'s behavior.

This helps Roo Code learn from its mistakes.\\n*   **Rewording Your Request:** Try rephrasing your initial task or providing more specific instructions.\\n*   **Manually Correcting:** If there are a few small issues, you can also directly modify the code before accepting the changes.\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n**Good Prompt:**\\n\\n> `@/src/components/Button.tsx` Refactor the `Button` component to use the `useState` hook instead of the `useReducer` hook.\\n\\n**Bad Prompt:**\\n\\n> Fix the button.\\n\\n**Good Prompt:**\\n\\n> Create a new file named `utils.py` and add a function called `calculate_average` that takes a list of numbers and returns their average.\\n\\n**Bad Prompt:**\\n\\n> Write some Python code.\\n\\n**Good Prompt:**\\n\\n> `@problems` Address all errors and warnings in the current file.\\n\\n**Bad Prompt:**\\n\\n> Fix everything.\\n\\nBy following these tips, you can write effective prompts that get the most out of Roo Code\\'s capabilities.\\n'}, {'path': 'advanced-usage/mcp.md', 'name': 'mcp.md', 'content': '# Model Context Protocol (MCP)\\n\\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard for extending Roo Code\\'s capabilities by connecting to external tools and services.  MCP servers can provide additional tools and resources that Roo Code can use to accomplish tasks.\\n\\n## Why Use MCP?\\n\\n*   **Extend Functionality:** Add new capabilities to Roo Code without modifying the core extension.\\n*   **Access External Data:** Connect to databases, APIs, or other services.\\n*   **Custom Integrations:** Create custom tools tailored to your specific workflow.\\n*   **Community Contributions:** Share and use tools developed by the Roo Code community.\\n\\n## MCP Server Status\\n\\nYou can view and manage your MCP server connections by clicking the <Codicon name=\"server\" /> icon in the top navigation bar.\\n\\n## Finding and Installing MCP Servers\\n\\nRoo Code does not come with any pre-installed MCP servers.  You\\'ll need to find and install them separately.\\n\\n*   **Community Repositories:**  Check for community-maintained lists of MCP servers.  (Link to a hypothetical community repo/list here)\\n*   **GitHub Search:** Search GitHub for \"MCP server\" or \"Model Context Protocol server.\"\\n*   **Ask Roo:**  You can ask Roo Code to help you find or even create MCP servers.\\n\\nInstallation typically involves adding the server\\'s configuration to the `cline_mcp_settings.json` file.  See the [Configuration](#configuration) section for details.\\n\\n## Using MCP Tools and Resources\\n\\nOnce an MCP server is connected, its tools and resources become available to Roo Code.\\n\\n*   **Tools:**  MCP tools are invoked using the `use_mcp_tool` tool.  You\\'ll need to provide the server name and the tool name.\\n*   **Resources:** MCP resources can be accessed using the `access_mcp_resource` tool.  You\\'ll need to provide the server name and the resource URI.\\n\\nRoo Code will prompt you for any required parameters when using these tools.\\n\\n## Creating Your Own MCP Server\\n\\nYou can create your own MCP server to add custom functionality to Roo Code.  This requires some programming knowledge.  See the [MCP documentation](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) for details on how to create an MCP server.\\n\\n## Configuration\\n\\nMCP server configurations are stored in the `cline_mcp_settings.json` file. You can access it from Roo Code\\'s settings by clicking on \"Edit MCP Settings\", or you can open it from the VS Code command palette with the `Roo Code: Open MCP Config` command.\\n\\nThe file uses a JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"mcpServers\": {\\n    \"server1\": {\\n      \"command\": \"python\",\\n      \"args\": [\"/path/to/server.py\"],\\n      \"env\": {\\n        \"API_KEY\": \"your_api_key\"\\n      },\\n      \"alwaysAllow\": [\"tool1\", \"tool2\"],\\n      \"disabled\": false\\n    },\\n    \"server2\": {\\n      \"command\": \"node\",\\n      \"args\": [\"/path/to/server.js\"],\\n      \"timeout\": 90\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Disabling MCP Features\\n\\nRoo Code provides two settings to control the use of MCP servers, to help you manage token usage and security:\\n\\n### 1. Disable MCP Servers Entirely\\n\\nIf you don\\'t want to use MCP servers at all, you can disable them completely:\\n\\n1. Open the Roo Code Settings (<Codicon name=\"gear\" />)\\n2. Find the \"Enable MCP Servers\" setting\\n3. Uncheck the box\\n\\nThis will prevent Roo Code from connecting to any MCP servers, and the `use_mcp_tool` and `access_mcp_resource` tools will not be available. This is the most secure option if you don\\'t intend to use MCP.\\n\\n### 2. Disable MCP Server Creation\\n\\nRoo Code can be asked to assist in creating new MCP servers. This is a powerful feature, but it also consumes more tokens and could potentially introduce security risks if used improperly.\\n\\nTo disable MCP server creation:\\n\\n1. Open the Roo Code Settings (<Codicon name=\"gear\" />)\\n2. Find the \"Enable MCP Server Creation\" setting\\n3. Uncheck the box\\n\\nWith this option disabled, Roo Code will not attempt to create new MCP servers. You can still use existing, manually configured servers.\\n\\nBy default, both of these options are enabled.'}, {'path': 'advanced-usage/rate-limits-costs.md', 'name': 'rate-limits-costs.md', 'content': '# Rate Limits and Costs\\n\\nUnderstanding and managing API usage is crucial for a smooth and cost-effective experience with Roo Code. This section explains how to track your token usage, costs, and how to configure rate limits.\\n\\n## Token Usage\\n\\nRoo Code interacts with AI models using tokens.  Tokens are essentially pieces of words.  The number of tokens used in a request and response affects both the processing time and the cost.\\n\\n*   **Input Tokens:** These are the tokens in your prompt, including the system prompt, your instructions, and any context provided (e.g., file contents).\\n*   **Output Tokens:** These are the tokens generated by the AI model in its response.\\n\\nYou can see the number of input and output tokens used for each interaction in the chat history.\\n\\n## Cost Calculation\\n\\nMost AI providers charge based on the number of tokens used.  Pricing varies depending on the provider and the specific model.\\n\\nRoo Code automatically calculates the estimated cost of each API request based on the configured model\\'s pricing.  This cost is displayed in the chat history, next to the token usage.\\n\\n**Note:**\\n\\n*   The cost calculation is an *estimate*.  The actual cost may vary slightly depending on the provider\\'s billing practices.\\n*   Some providers may offer free tiers or credits.  Check your provider\\'s documentation for details.\\n*   Some providers offer prompt caching which greatly lowers cost.\\n\\n## Configuring Rate Limits\\n\\nTo prevent accidental overuse of the API and to help you manage costs, Roo Code allows you to set a rate limit.  The rate limit specifies the minimum time (in seconds) between API requests.\\n\\n**How to configure:**\\n\\n1.  Open the Roo Code settings (<Codicon name=\"rocket\" /> icon in the top right corner).\\n2.  Go to the \"Advanced Settings\" section.\\n3.  Find the \"Rate Limit (seconds)\" setting.\\n4.  Enter the desired delay in seconds.  A value of 0 disables rate limiting.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\nIf you set the rate limit to 10 seconds, Roo Code will wait at least 10 seconds after one API request completes before sending the next one.\\n\\n## Tips for Optimizing Token Usage\\n\\n*   **Be Concise:**  Use clear and concise language in your prompts. Avoid unnecessary words or details.\\n*   **Provide Only Relevant Context:** Use context mentions (`@file.ts`, `@folder/`) selectively.  Only include the files that are directly relevant to the task.\\n*   **Break Down Tasks:** Divide large tasks into smaller, more focused sub-tasks.\\n*   **Use Custom Instructions:**  Provide custom instructions to guide Roo Code\\'s behavior and reduce the need for lengthy explanations in each prompt.\\n*   **Choose the Right Model:**  Some models are more cost-effective than others.  Consider using a smaller, faster model for tasks that don\\'t require the full power of a larger model.\\n*   **Use Modes:** Different modes can access different tools, for example `Architect` can\\'t modify code, which makes it a safe choice when analyzing a complex codebase, without worrying about accidentally allowing expensive operations.\\n*   **Disable MCP If Not Used:** If you\\'re not using MCP (Model Context Protocol) features, consider [disabling it in the MCP settings](./mcp#disabling-mcp-features) to significantly reduce the size of the system prompt and save tokens.\\n\\nBy understanding and managing your API usage, you can use Roo Code effectively and efficiently.'}, {'path': 'getting-started/your-first-task.md', 'name': 'your-first-task.md', 'content': '---\\nsidebar_label: Your First Task\\n---\\n\\n# Starting Your First Task with Roo Code\\n\\nNow that you\\'ve [configured your AI provider and model](./connecting-api-provider), you\\'re ready to start using Roo Code! This guide will walk you through your first interaction.\\n\\n## Step 1: Open the Roo Code Panel\\n\\nIf the Roo Code panel isn\\'t already visible, click the Roo Code icon (<Codicon name=\"rocket\" />) in the VS Code Activity Bar (the vertical bar on the side of the window). This will open the Roo Code chat interface.  If you don\\'t see the icon, make sure the extension is installed and enabled.\\n\\n## Step 2: Type Your Task\\n\\nIn the Roo Code chat box (at the bottom of the panel), type a description of what you want Roo Code to do.  Be clear and concise.  Here are some examples of good initial tasks:\\n\\n*   \"Create a file named `hello.txt` containing \\'Hello, world!\\'.\"\\n*   \"Write a Python function that adds two numbers.\"\\n*    \"Create an html file for a simple website with the title \\'Roo test\\'\"\\n\\nYou don\\'t need to use any special commands or syntax at this point.  Just write your request in plain English.\\n\\n## Step 3: Send Your Task\\n\\nPress Enter, or click the Send icon (<Codicon name=\"send\" />) to the right of the input box.\\n\\n## Step 4: Review and Approve Actions\\n\\nRoo Code will analyze your request and propose a series of actions.  These actions might include:\\n\\n*   **Reading files:** Roo Code will show you the contents of files it wants to read.\\n*   **Writing to files:** Roo Code will show you a diff (a visual representation of the changes) of any proposed file modifications.  You\\'ll see added lines in green and removed lines in red.\\n*   **Executing commands:** Roo Code will show you the exact command it wants to run in your terminal.\\n*   **Using the Browser:** Roo Code will show you the action it\\'s going to perform (click, type, etc)\\n* **Asking a question:** If Roo Code is not sure on how to proceed, it will ask you follow-up questions.\\n\\n**You will have the opportunity to approve or reject each action.**  Roo Code will not perform any action without your explicit permission (unless you\\'ve enabled auto-approval in the settings).\\n\\n*   **Approve:** If you\\'re happy with the proposed action, click the \"Approve\" button (or similar).\\n*   **Reject:** If you don\\'t want Roo Code to perform the action, click the \"Reject\" button. You can provide feedback to help Roo Code understand why you rejected the action.\\n\\n## Step 5: Iterate\\n\\nRoo Code works iteratively.  After each action, it will wait for your feedback and then propose the next step.  Continue reviewing and approving (or rejecting) actions until the task is complete.'}, {'path': 'getting-started/installing.md', 'name': 'installing.md', 'content': '---\\nsidebar_label: Installing Roo Code\\n---\\n\\n# Installing Roo Code\\n\\nRoo Code is a VS Code extension that brings AI-powered coding assistance to your editor.
